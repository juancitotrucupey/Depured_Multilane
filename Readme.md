Cellular automaton for multilane simulations:

The project is written in C++ and the data analysis is done in Python. The current implementation only supports one core wokrflow, it is a pending work to parallelize this code.

This code is part ot the project "Traffic simulation with cellular automaton" at the research group Simulation of Physical Systems at the National University of Colombia. 

The model implemented is original work of the research group.
