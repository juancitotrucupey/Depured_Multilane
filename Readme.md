#Cellular automaton for multilane simulations:

## Description
The project is written in C++ and the data analysis is done in Python. The current implementation only supports one core wokrflow, it is a pending work to parallelize this code.

This code is part ot the project "Traffic simulation with cellular automaton" at the research group Simulation of Physical Systems at the National University of Colombia. 

The model implemented is original work of the research group.

## Where to learn about this

The resutls of this work where presented at the Traffic and Granular Flow that took place in Navarra, Spain on 2019, you can take a look at the poster [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18sZLUpGvvyk6az-Vn1P42fnXg804X_fL/view?usp=sharing).

If  you want to take a deeper look into the theory of CA for traffic simulation and the analysis done in this work you can take a look at my [undregrad thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iW4wcanFF1jaBMap7b8ekN22cE6Hvyzb/view?usp=sharing).
