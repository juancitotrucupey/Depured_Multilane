## Urgent changes

When discussing with the professor Jose Daniel we found that the one lane algorithm was allowing for crashes in some odd situations, so we solved that and is necessary to modify the lane changing rule to accomodate for this.

## Further changes

1) Use the real position gap and velocity gap
2) Change the names of the output files using a good notation
3) Add the gap position and gap velocity to the Olmos-Munoz evolution
4) Use only one type of lane change
5) Simplify the lane changing rules
6) Simplify the implementations of the boundaries
